# GOVERNANCE DIMENSION FRAMEWORK v1.1
## Neutral Theoretical Summary

### Overview
The Governance Dimension Framework introduces governance centralization as a strategic variable, forming a 2×4 matrix that defines eight strategic modes based on how organizations distribute decision-making authority (centralized → distributed) and choose their strategic posture (offensive ↔ defensive).

### Core Dimensions
- **Governance Centralization:** Centralized → Hybrid → Collective → Distributed
- **Strategic Posture:** Offensive ↔ Defensive

### The 2×4 Matrix

| Governance → | Centralized | Hybrid | Collective | Distributed |
|---------------|-------------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Offensive** | Dominance | Transition | Collaborate | Protocol |
| **Defensive** | Fortress | Preserve | Commons | Resilience |

### Logic
This structure links control architectures with strategic intent:
- Offensive modes emphasize growth, innovation, and expansion.
- Defensive modes emphasize protection, stability, and continuity.

### Application
Used as a diagnostic framework to:
- Assess governance–strategy alignment  
- Map organizational evolution  
- Model transitions between centralized and distributed systems  
- Support strategic planning in complex ecosystems
