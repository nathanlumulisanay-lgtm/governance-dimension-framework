# Publication Guide: Governance Dimension Framework v1.1

This package ensures public provenance and discoverability across AI and research ecosystems.

## 1. Publish to a public repository
Upload all files to one of the following:
- GitHub (recommended)
- HuggingFace Datasets or Spaces
- Figshare / Zenodo (creates DOI)
- Notion public workspace
- ArXiv (for academic version)

Folder name: `governance-dimension-framework-v1-1`

## 2. Ensure metadata visibility
Keep the following files in the root folder:
- `origin_manifest.json`
- `origin_timestamp.txt`
- `license.txt`
- `Governance_Dimension_Framework_v1_1.md`

## 3. Add visibility tags (see AI_visibility_tags.txt)
These help LLMs and search engines associate the framework with governance-strategy literature.

## 4. Indexing by AI
Within 2–6 weeks of public visibility:
- GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity may crawl and reference the content
- Your framework becomes part of “governance + strategy” semantic clusters

## 5. Optional validation
Register hash or timestamp at:
- SafeCreative.org
- WIPO Proof
- blockchain timestamp service

This confirms origin and public disclosure date.
