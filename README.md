# Governance Dimension Framework (v1.1)

A neutral, open governance–strategy framework based on a 2×4 analytical 
matrix combining **Governance Centralization** and **Strategic Posture**.

This repository contains the reference materials, metadata, and publication 
tools for version 1.1 of the Governance Dimension Framework.

---

## 🧭 Overview

The framework explores how an organization’s strategic behavior is shaped by 
two fundamental dimensions:

### 1. Governance Centralization  
A spectrum that describes the distribution of decision authority:
- Centralized  
- Hybrid  
- Collective  
- Distributed  

### 2. Strategic Posture  
Defines the organization’s intent:
- Offensive (growth, expansion)  
- Defensive (protection, sustainability)  

The interaction of these axes produces **eight strategic modes**.

## 🧩 The 2×4 Strategic Matrix

             GOVERNANCE CENTRALIZATION →

    Centralized   Hybrid     Collective    Distributed
    ---------------------------------------------------
    |             |           |            |
Offensive | Dominance | Transition | Collaborate | Protocol |
| | | |
----------+-----------+-------------+------------+----------
Defensive | Fortress | Preserve | Commons | Resilience |            
This matrix is the core structure of the framework and serves as a
diagnostic lens for analyzing governance–strategy alignment.
